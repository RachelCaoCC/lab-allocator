# SoCo - *Resource Maximisation Planning System for Labs*

Our aim for this project is to create a resource allocation application for SoCo computer labs. The app will make use of resources available and be adaptable to new entries to create a working timetable for the Computing courses and the limited resources (Computer Lab rooms) whilst following a strict set of pre-defined constraints and restrictions.

The end vision of the project will be to have a application that will adapt to new entries and create the best layout of courses in a given week based on the strict restrictions and constraints.

As SoCo is a new project beginning in Semester 1, 2024. There is currently no content in the GitHub but will be structured and laid out as the project evolves.
