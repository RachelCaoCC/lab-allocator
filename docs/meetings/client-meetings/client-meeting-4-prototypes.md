## Content from the meeting
- Trying to upload data with a file
  - Clicked on the button for the file upload, then can do drag and drop
  - Ok with predetermined format for the data - headers in a spreadsheet / CSV
  - CSV is fine and probably easier
  - Exiting out of prompt, need to click outside the boundary
- Wanting to change the data for a given class
  - Probably need some kind of confirmation whether or not a given field has been changed
  - Seems pretty intuitive for opening the data editor and then editing things
  - Much more user friendly at the moment than what they are currently using
  - Future flow for an add button to add a manual class
    - "Would be great to have a manual option ... for people (convenors) who miss deadlines ... saves us from uploading another CSV..." (
- Updating the values for the algorithm
- Going back to home screen also seems intuitive
- Results for the outputs
  - Will be labels on each course in the future
  - (Will run out of colours if we don't label them)
  - Happy with the drag and drop interface for moving classes around
  - Will not let individual convenors have access to the drag and drop timetable interface
  - Happy with the other view too for seeing individual classes
  - For rearranging them can just drag and then it throws up a message with 2 options if there is a clash, and then also shows locations to put it
  - Belinda: okay to not validate the locations show (i.e. allow this interface to override e.g. the tutor ratios)
  - Lets you toggle on and off all of the classes
