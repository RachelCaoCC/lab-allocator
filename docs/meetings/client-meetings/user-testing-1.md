### User Testing in Week 6.

*To be completed on the 23/08/24*

Belinda, Filip, Edward, Alex

## Agenda
- User testing and colour schemes
- Going over the spreadsheet of data we'd received
- 
## Side-Agenda
- Could we ask what risks we have for the project, so we can write up a risk register. Should be easy enough to write out.

## Meeting Minutes
- Colour schemes
  - Belinda has taken a look at the colour schemes before the meeting
  - The plain black/gray one was not going to work
    - Doesn't let you match classes across the timetable because the colours are all the same
  - The pastels were the preferred one, but anything except for the single-coloured one would work
  - Will try to generate more of the pastel ones for next time
- Spreadsheet of data
  - May have accidentally deleted the course size data when pre-processing the data
  - Don't have lecture times / days yet
  - Convenors cannot request an exact lecture time, but can specify a window of days where it could be placed
  - By the time we generate the lab timetable, lecture times will be known
  - Next semester's data is currently with convenors at the moment - not due until September
  - Data we have right now is for the current semester
  - Currently has free text input for requirements, we should be able to give them a more structured input where its broken down more logically
    - Asking more direct questions should help with the more common requests
  - The Microsoft Form just gives you the spreadsheet directly from the responses
- User testing
  - We don't have documentation yet, so will do some testing to see how intuitive it is to use
