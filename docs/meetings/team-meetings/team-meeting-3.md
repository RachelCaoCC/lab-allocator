## Agenda:

Our agenda for this meeting will be to practice and finalise our preparations for the audit tutorial today including organising slideshows and document notes to be ready for the audit tutorial.

If time allows, we should instruct the team members on how to use GitHub projects to organise tasks, create dummy tasks, create issues from the tasks and whatever else we can use in that situation.
We can then designate someone or a group of members to organise the tasks page to reflect a more detailed approach to our plan for the project.

## Content from the meeting

We worked on the presentation and what we would cover in the presentation. As well as working on our individual speeches and practiced to make sure we were in time.

We discussed how to use the projects tab in GitHub and will be setup to reflect the roadmap and features for the coming semester.

Below are the links to the presentation and speeches.

## Future Meetings

For future meetings we should be looking at resolving/reflecting on the feedback we receive in the tutorial session today. This means that we will have to redefine certain aspects of the project as well.
