## Agenda:

- Go over again the audit requirements, in particular the criteria that we will be marked on.
- Make sure that we have a working demo that we can present reliably on the day.
- Recap what happened for the user testing.
- Matthew could perhaps go through his implementation of the MongoDB database on the VM.
- Recap for the other team members what is happening with the VM on campus.
- Detail out what we should be doing for this week.
- Reminder that we should be communicating on Github and use teams as a method of gaining peoples attention a bit quicker. And for asking non-trivial questions, but if it is something important to the project, you should be reciting it in the github issue that it is relevant to. This includes if it is a decision or a reflection.
